                The dark room was clouded with smoke as the 1st lieutenant entered the room. He walked slowly , trying to avoid the big clouds, towards the black desk where a man in black cape was sitting and enjoying his last cigar.

                ???: What do you want Xephurus? Xephurus: I'm sorry to disturb you lord Reigor, but I have found the perfect team for the mission, as you asked me to. Reigor: Oh really? Show me. Xephurus: Here are their files, the first one, Vincent, is an ex dragon knight wit... Reigor: A dragon knight here in the "World government army"? I thought they were all killed, protecting the dragons in "the great dragon war" 85 years ago? Xephurus: Not all of them , some fled and spread around the world. But just very few ,it is estimated to be less then 20 of them left. Raigor: Oh, so he is quite unqiue then. But why is he in the very same army that killed mostly of his comrades 85 years ago. Xephurus: That, I dont know. Anyway, he has not failed a single mission yet. Our second man, or should I say woman, for the team is Holly, unlike the other two soldiers, she is a general. Raigor: A general? She doesn't look like she is older then 20! Xephurus: She is 21, she got trained from a very early age from her father who I think you know is. Captain Salvador, the legendandary swordsman, who got killed in a fight 2 years ago against the leader of the Rebel force. Raigor: ...yes. So that is his daughter. Xephurus: Yes. Now to the third one. I don't know if I made the right choice here but there is something about this kid, let me read his file: Damien Nezil , half deamon, found as a abbandoned baby outside a fosterhome 19 years ago. Joined the army recently after searching for for his ancestors, the deamon tribe,for 4 years but without results. Completed and returned alone from 2 out of 2 A-rank exploring missions. Raigor: Returned alone? Xephurus: Yes, his comrades died on the 30-man missions we knew was sucides missions in order to explore and give us information about dangerous areas of the Eolnyss world map. He has both times returned alone with information. Raigor: Hmm I wonder what his skills are, considering he is a human with deamon blood running through his veins. Good Work Xephurus, you are dissmissed.

            <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-4 chapter">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Chapter 2: The Mission</h2>
                Damien suddenly sat up in his bed, yawning the sleepiness out. Loud knocks could be heard coming from the door. He put on some cloths and headed for the door. Another loud round of banging could be heard.

                Damien: yeah yeah Im coming, stop the house demolishing will ya. Damien oppened the door Soldier: Orders from officer rufus. You, Damien Nazil, must attend to a confidential meeting in the Headquarters at 12.00 today. We will escort you there, you have exactly 10 minutes to get your equipment and items you want to bring. Damien: Whats all this ruckus, I dont have any meeting scheduled today? Soldier: This is newly recevied informartion and of most importants , that is all I know. Please hurry. Damien: yeah whatever * he said and slammed the door right infront of the soldier and started packing his stuff*
                
                When Damien entered the conference room at the headquarters the first thing he saw was a young girl sitting on a chair at the table not far from the entrance, next he saw a strange looking guy, sitting in the corner with a giant, long, spear shaped lance on his shoulder. Damien noticed that he was not wearing any army uniform but something that looked like black snake skin. He was starring in the ground but as Damien entered he looked up for a few seconds and then down again. Damien was just going to ask question as officer Rufus entered.
                
                Rufus: Hello, soldiers and officers. You are problary wondering why you are here, so Im going to explain what I have been told to explain from my superiors. You three are going on a mission and therefor you are from now on a team. Damien: What? I hardly know these too wierdos and.. Holly: HEY! who are you calling wierdo , I'm higher rank then you soldier. Damien: Whatever. Holly ignored him Holly: But sir, Whats up with this sudden mission? And why is it only a three-man mission? Rufus: I will explain that now if you let me speak.
                
                Damien and Holly where both quiet now even though you could see that they had more coming.
                
                Rufus: Thats better. You have all been chosen by one of my superiors for this mission. This is a confidential mission, what is spoken about in this room stays in this room. Those are the orders. 2 days ago something of importants was stolen from the laboratory in Treno (The main capital of Eolnyss) was stolen by the Rebel forces. A crystal to be more precise. Information tells us they are headed towards the forrest of illusions north of here. The mission is to retrieve the crystal by any means necissary. Damien: Why not send a 20-man team if it is so important? Holly: Idiot, then they will see us coming from continents away. Rufus: Exactly. It takes about 4 days to reach the forrest of illusions from Treno and only 3 days from here. But since they left 2 days ago we must asume that they are 1 day ahead of you. So you must have a fast pace. Holly you have been the assigned the leader for this mission. Holly: Good, but sir, if it is as you say, we must leave immediatly then. Rufus: Yes, you are dissmissed. Oh yeah , and one more thing. We do not have any information according the streangh of the Rebel group so be really carefull.
                
                Damien smiled and then walked out of the room followed by the other two.
                
                Holly: Okey, let me just make this clear. I am the leader of this mission , you two do as I say, got it? Damien: whatever. Vincent: Yes. Holly: Good, I dont know what they where thinking when they put us three togheter who has no experience in working togheter or knowledge of eachother skills. Damien: Who cares, we got to get a move on. Holly: yes, sorry. We will cross Grean planes to get to the forrest of illusions. I will take the lead you follow me. Lets move out.
                
                Holly was running infront while the other two was some meters behind here. Damien: Soo, whats your name? Vincent: Vincent.. Damien: okay, so whats your story? Vincent: .... Nothing that is necissary to know about for this mission. Damien: oookay... well Im just gonna talk little with the big boss. he said and increased his pace a little to catch up with Holly
                
                Damien: Creepy guy back there. who is he? And why is he wearing that snake skin? Holly sighed Holly: Dont you know anything? He is a dragon knight and the thing he is wearing is not snake skin its dragon scale which happens to be one of the most strongest materials in the world. Damien: Ah a dragon knight eh? hmm, never heard of it. Holly: Idiot... Damien: shut up. Holly: The dragon knights where humans living with the dragons. They recieved dragon magics and learnings, and they always protected the dragons. But 85 years ago , the world government atacked the dragons because they were seen as a threath to the humans. Almost every dragon and dragon knight was exterminated but some fled when the battle was already lost. I think vincent here is one of those. Damien: Whaaat? but how can that be? he doesnt look much older then 30. You said it happened 85 years ago! Holly: I also said that they have recieved dragon magics, and a dragon has 8 longer life span then a human. I believe Vincent has gotten some of that increased life span from the magic. Damien: I see..
                
                A moment of silence was cast upon them.
                
                Damien: Oh, cool swords you got there. Can I see them? Holly: No you can not. Damien: Bah, aren't you the boring one. By the way how come a cute girl like you end up officer in the army? Holly blushed Holly: That.. That's none of your buisness. Damien: Chill, I was just asking. Holly: sorry, my father was a captain in the army, he was called the legendary swordsman. Damien: "He was a captain"? Holly: yeah... he got killed in a fight against the rebel leader 2 years ago... Damien: I'm Sorry to hear that.. Holly: thanks.. I was raised with just him as a father since my mother died of sickness when I was just a baby. I trained everyday from a young age and I wanted to be just like him. Damien: Well atleast you knew one of your parents... Holly: what do you mean...? Didn't you? Damien: Well... I was a foster child. Holly: Oh..I see..
                
                The silence once again hit them like a punch in the stomach. They continued running without saying anything for what was left of the day.
                
                Holly: Lets set up the tent, its getting late and its easier to get ambushed in the dark. Damien: yeah good idea.
                
                They all fell asleep fast and got up as soon as the sun rose to continue the pursuit. After 12 hours running , Vincent suddenly spoke. His voice startled Damien and Holly since they where not used to hear him speak.
                
                Vincent: I can see them. They are not far away. Holly: What? I dont see anything. Vincent: It's dragon vision. Holly: oh. Vincent: It's 2-man group. Holly: speed up guys, lets catch up to them now.
                
                30minutes later Vincent spoke again.
                
                Vincent: What the?? Holly: What is it? Vincent: They stopped, now they are turning around. Damien: Shit, they spotted us. Vincent: They are smiling at us. Holly: They are waiting for us... Prepare yourselves.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Chapter 3: The Battles</h2>
                Damien , Holly and Vincent landed infront of the Rebels. They watched the two really big men carefully. One of them had what seemed to be a giant hammer and the other one some strange looking gloves.

                Man #1: Hehe it seems as we have some followers , brother gill. Gill: yeah followers, brother Bill. Bill: They are soldiers for the government, problary here to recover the crystal. Holly: thats right, hand it over. Bill: Why should I hand over a item which brings death. Holly: Stop your nonsense. And give it to us. Bill: haha , you pawns understand so little of reallity. Holly: As you wish Rebel scum, we shall the the crystal with force. Prepare yourself * she said and withdrew her swords*
                
                The two brothers started laughing.
                
                Gill: It's funny you mention that since we are the ones being prepared for the longest. he clapped his hands togheter *Explosion arts: Release * Damien: shit a trap both he and vinced jumped to the side
                
                Holly was not fast enough and had just barely began to jump before the explosive sent her far away, landing hard on the ground.
                
                Damien: HOLLY! shiiit! Holly are you okay?
                
                Holly did not reply. Vincent examined her.
                
                Vincent: She is alive, but uncounsious. Damien turned against them.
                
                Damien: You bastards, you will die!
                
                Gill: Oh I only got one of them. Bill: well no worries, now its one for each of us. Gill: I want the bad tempered guy. Bill: fine then I will take the funny looking guy with the big lance.
                
                Damien vs Gill
                
                Damien ran towards one of the brother sending a punch towards him. It was evaded by Gill and countered with a punch of his own towards Damiens chest. A explosion was created and Damien flew backwards
                
                Gill: hehe, you see my gloves are just not good looking, they also make a minor explosion when they come in contact with anything.
                
                Damien stood up, coughing up some blood and then smiled.
                
                Damien: I see, I'll just have to fight fire with fire then * Deamon arts: Flaming Fist and both Damiens hands ignited* Gill: ooh I never seen that one before. Damien: And you problary are not going to again. * Damien rushed towards Gill again and this time landed a strong punch on his cheek making him fly backwards and onto the ground* Damien: How do you like that, huh!
                
                Gill: hhehehehe... * Explosive arts: release * Damien looked down on his leg, where a small bomb had been atached, started beeping. Damien: Shit, when did h.... the bomb exploded
                
                Gill: haha, while I was flying backwards from your punch I threw a self ataching bomb on you , to small to be noticed while concentrating on a fight. Damien had a deep wound now on his leg, pouring out louds of blood. He grouned. Damien: Shit...I was to careless. * he ignited his right hand again * Gill: what is he doing`?
                
                Damien took his burning first and pressed it hard against the wound. He groaned in pain. When he removed his hand the skin was burned togheter and the bleeding had stopped.
                
                Damien: Do you know what gives deamons streantgh he asked without looking away from the burnmark on his leg Gill: no..why would I? Damien: Pain * he said with a demonic voice and looked up*
                
                His eyes where red as blood. Gill stepped back.
                
                Gill: Wha... Whaatt are you?
                
                Damien stood up. And suddenly he disappeared and appeared next to Gill, whispering in his ear.
                
                Damien: Its over... * he ignited his left fist again and uppercut Gill in the stomach making him fly up in to the air*
                
                Damien jumped after, and landed hundreds of punches within seconds. Then apeared above him, Demon arts: Dark.. matter.. , a dark sphere was created between both of his hand. He raised both of his hand above his head and then launched the sphere towards the chest of Gill making him fly at an extreme speed into the ground creating a small crater under him. Damien landed next to him and seconds later the eyes turned back to normal and Damien fell backwards on the ground.
                
                MEANWHILE
                
                Bill wildly swung his giant hammer against vincent leaving him no opportunity to counter atack.
                
                Bill: haha whats the matter. Afraid to atack? Well then I'll go * he raised his hammer high and then bashed it into the ground infront of Vincent, sending a big shockwave to him*
                
                Vincent flew to the side and landed on his back.
                
                Bill: mwahahaha, this is to easy he charged toward Vincent with his hammer raised on his right shoulder
                
                Vincent had just gotten up before he was hit in the side by the giant hammer. Vincent bounced on the ground.
                
                Bill: Im not done yet and he charged again towards Vincent
                
                Vincent got on his knees and jumped far up in the sky seconds before the hammer would hit him.
                
                Gill: what the? Vincent: * Dragon arts: Dragon breath , and vincent released a cloud of fire from his mouth.*
                
                The fire and heat wave pushed gill away on the ground landing on his back. Vincent came diving from the sky with his Lance pointing at Gill.
                
                Gill: Shit * he lifted up his hammer infront of him and parried the sharp edge of the lance*
                
                Vincent then landed on the hammer and jumped up again, Dragon arts: Lance of thunder , he raised his lance as electricity surrounded it and then threw it. The lance was surrounded by electricity in the form of a dragon. Gill lifted up hiss hammer in order to parry.
                
                Vincent: Its no use...
                
                The lance went straight thrue his hammer and pierced his chest. Vincent landed and removed the lance. He was at his limit. He looked for Damien, and he saw that he seemed to be okay but exhausted. Vincent thrust his spear into the ground and then sat down next to it.
